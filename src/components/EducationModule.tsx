    smallBusinessPay: "Do small businesses pay Company Income Tax (CIT)?",
    smallBusinessPayAns: "No — if your annual turnover is ₦100 million or less (and fixed assets ≤ ₦250m), you pay 0% CIT. This exemption helps small traders, farmers, and freelancers keep more money to grow (Nigeria Tax Act 2025, small company exemption).",

    doIKeepRecordsOfSales: "Do I need to keep records of my sales and expenses?",

    whatIsATCC: "What is a Tax Clearance Certificate (TCC) and why do I need it?",
    whatIsATCCAns: "A TCC proves you have no outstanding tax. You need it for contracts, loans, or big business deals. Request it in the app after filing — it's digital now (NTAA Section 72).",

    whatHappensIfIPayLate: "What happens if I file or pay late?",
    whatHappensIfIPayLateAns: "You may pay penalties (e.g., 10% of tax + ₦25,000 for late filing) and interest (1.5% per month). The app sends reminders and calculates penalties so you can avoid them (NTAA Sections 65, 101).",
